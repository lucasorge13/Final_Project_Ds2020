# Global Air Travel Analysis using OpenFlights

## Overview
This data science project explores global air travel patterns using datasets from the OpenFlights database. We analyze airline networks, airport connectivity, geographic coverage, and operational characteristics to reveal insights into global aviation trends.

## Data Sources
Data was obtained from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.php):
- `airlines.dat`: Airlines data including operational status.
- `airports.dat`: Airport location and operational details.
- `routes.dat`: Flight routes between airports.
- `planes.dat`: Aircraft types and equipment information.
- `countries.dat`: Country codes and geographic metadata.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze the structure of global airline route networks.
- Examine geographic coverage and identify underserved regions.
- Study operational characteristics, including fleet usage and route lengths.

## Completed Steps
- Data loading and cleaning:
  - Handling missing and invalid data.
  - Filtering for active airlines and valid airports.
- Joining datasets (routes, airlines, airports).

## Methodology
- Data wrangling and exploratory analysis using **R**.
