Next Steps:

1. EDA & Summary Report
   - Write an RMarkdown that:  
     - Loads & cleans the routes/airports tables.  
     - Computes the top 10 busiest airports and busiest country pairs.  
     - Produces 2–3 quick ggplot2 visuals (bar chart of top airports; heatmap of flights by country).  

2. Basic Network Graph with igraph  
   - Build a directed graph of airports → routes.  
   - Compute and table out degree centrality for each airport (top 20).  
   - Plot a simple network diagram highlighting the top 5 hubs (using ggraph).

3. Geo‑Mapping with leaflet  
   - Map all routes as great‑circle lines on an interactive leaflet map.  
   - Add circle markers sized by each airport’s degree.  
   - Enable popups showing airport name and degree.

4. Mini Forecast of Route Volume  
   - Aggregate monthly total flights across all routes.  
   - Fit a simple ETS or auto.arima model (forecast package).  
   - Plot the next 6‑month forecast with forecast::autoplot.

5. Shiny “Route Explorer” Prototype  
   - Inputs: select one airport or airline.  
   - Outputs: table of its direct connections and a small network widget (e.g. visNetwork).  
   - Deploy locally (or via rsconnect) for stakeholder demos.

6. Lightweight Automation & Scheduling 
   - Write a small R script that can be scheduled (cron or taskscheduleR) to re‐run your EDA and save updated figures.  
   - Document how to run it in one command: `Rscript update_report.R`.

7. Finalize

Data Storytelling Angle

How concentrated is global air traffic?

What regions or aircraft types dominate air travel?

What might the network look like if underserved areas were better connected?
