# Final_Project_Ds2020

# Global Air Travel Analysis using OpenFlights

**Lucas Martins Sorge, Nina De Grandis, Brandon Merrick**

## Introduction

This data science project explores global air travel patterns using datasets from the OpenFlights database. We analyze airline networks, airport connectivity, geographic coverage, and operational characteristics to reveal insights into global aviation trends. Our goal during this project is to find when and where air traffic is more concentrated. We also want to analyze the structure of global airline route networks, examine geographic coverage and identify underserved regions, and study operational characteristics, including fleet usage and route lengths.

Questions: - How concentrated is global air traffic? - How does airport connectivity vary between developed and developing countries? - What country has the most airports? Where are the countries with the most airports located, and what patterns are there? - Brandon's - Brandon's

## Data Sources

Data was obtained from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.php): - `airlines.dat`: Airlines data including operational status. - `airports.dat`: Airport location and operational details. - `routes.dat`: Flight routes between airports. - `planes.dat`: Aircraft types and equipment information. - `countries.dat`: Country codes and geographic metadata.

## Project Objectives

-   Analyze the structure of global airline route networks.
-   Examine geographic coverage and identify underserved regions.
-   Study operational characteristics, including fleet usage and route lengths.

## Completed Steps

-   Data loading and cleaning:
    -   Handling missing and invalid data.
    -   Filtering for active airlines and valid airports.
-   Joining datasets (routes, airlines, airports).

## Methodology

-   Our analysis was conducted entirely in **R**, leveraging a combination of data wrangling, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques.

## Data Cleaning

We cleaned and prepared five OpenFlights datasets (airlines, airports, routes, planes, countries) by:

-   Replacing `"\\N"` with `NA` and removing rows with missing critical fields.
-   Filtering for relevant records: active airlines, valid airports, and direct routes only.
-   Converting data types (e.g., IDs, coordinates) for consistency.
-   Standardizing column names using `clean_names()`.
-   Joining datasets: routes were linked with airline, airport, country, and plane details.
-   Exploding and summarizing equipment data for route-level analysis.

The result is a cleaned and merged dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

## Results

*Question 1:* **How concentrated is global air traffic?**

-   **Extreme airport-level inequality**
    -   Lorenz Curve bows sharply below the line of perfect equality, indicating most flights funnel through a few major hubs.\
    -   **Gini coefficient (airports): 0.78**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lorenz_airport.png")
```

-   **Top-percentile shares**
    -   **Top 1%** of airports handle **\~20%** of all flights\
    -   **Top 5%** handle **\~53%** of all flights\
    -   **Top 10%** handle **\~70%** of all flights
-   **Leading hubs**
    -   The busiest airports—**Atlanta (ATL)**, **Chicago O’Hare (ORD)**, **Beijing Capital (PEK)**, etc.—together account for a disproportionately large share of global traffic.
-   **Route-level distribution**
    -   Lorenz Curve for routes lies closer to the equality line, showing a more even spread across connections.\
    -   **Gini coefficient (routes): 0.31**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lorenz_route.png")
```

-   **Key routes**
    -   Top connections (e.g., **ORD → ATL**, **JFK → LHR**) are busiest but represent a smaller overall share compared to top airports.
-   **Conclusion**
    -   Global aviation has a **dual structure**: a small number of dominant hubs manage the bulk of air traffic, while a wide range of routes ensures broad global connectivity and operational resilience.

*Question 2:* **How does airport connectivity vary between developed and developing countries?**

-   **Stronger connectivity in developed countries**
    -   Airports in developed countries show significantly higher average connectivity than those in developing countries.
    -   **Average connectivity** (number of outgoing routes per airport) is roughly **twice as high** in developed nations.
-   **Statistical evidence**
    -   Welch Two Sample t-test: **p = 0.0079**
    -   Mann-Whitney U test: **p = 0.0228**
    -   Both confirm that the difference is **statistically significant**.
-   **Top connected countries**
    -   Most countries with the highest average connectivity (e.g., **United States**, **Germany**, **France**) are developed.
    -   Some **developing countries** like the **UAE** and **Singapore** stand out as exceptions due to geographic or economic advantages.
-   **Visual insights**
    -   A global map of airports shows large hubs (colored by development status) are clustered in **North America, Europe, and East Asia**.
    -   Airports in developing countries tend to be more **regionally focused** with lower integration into global flight networks.

```

-   **Conclusion**
    -   Global airport connectivity reflects broader economic inequalities.
    -   Developed countries are far more integrated into the air transportation network, both in infrastructure and route diversity.

*Question 3:* **What country has the most airports? Where are the countries with the most airports located, and what patterns are there?**

Top 25 Countries by Number of Airports

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/airports.png")
```

-   This bar chart shows the top 25 countries by number of airports, and how many airports they have. I chose to only shows the top 25 because any more countries made the graph very hard to read.
-   There are 235 countries in the data set, and everything below the top 25 has only 45 or less airports.
-   The United States takes a staggering lead, with 1251 airports. The next closest is Canada, with 380.
-   Only the top 10 countries have 100 or more airports. - These top 10 countries are among the most populated countries in the world, which would make sense why they have the most airports.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/countries.png")
```

-   This map shows where the airports for the top 25 countries by number of airports are located.
-   I notice several trends when looking at this map. First, many of the airports are along the coast. This makes sense as these may be more populated areas, especially when accounting for tourism and economic activity.
-   When talking about population, this may be why some areas are blank and without an airport for miles. Australia for example, has most of their population centered in big cities and along the coasts. An airport in the middle of Australia isn't very necessary. This is similar to Russia, where there is a seeming lack of airports for the size of the country. Russia's climate and population distribution accounts for this.
-   Another noticeable trend is that Africa is completely left out of the top 25, except for one country, being South Africa. Most every other region of the world has a country with many airports, making travel very accessible.

*Question 4:* **What airports have the most unique flights to and from them**

-   **Majority are in the US**

    -   The highest by far is ATL, but 4 of the top 10 are also in the US (ORD, LAX, DFW, and JFK)

-   **China has a few big ones**

    -   The 3rd largest, PEK, as well as PVG are in China
    -   Other Asian countries with large airports are Singapore and South Korea

-   **Remaining Large Airports are all in Europe**

    -   UK, France, and Germany are the main countries with large airports
    -   Surrounding Western European countries like Spain and the Netherlands also have some large airports.

    ```

*Question 5:* **What Brand of Plane is Most Popular**

- **Plane Type is concentrated**
  - Majority are Boeing, Airbus, Douglas, or Embraer
  - Some only have one of that plane
- **Only 246 planes so pretty small sample size**

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this analysis has helped us understand global air travel and the trends and patterns we were looking for. The biggest thing we concluded that had an effect on global air travel is population. This affects where airports are located, how many per country, how large the airport is, and more. More developed countries also have a better air travel system. The largest and most frequented airports can be found in countries like the US and China, highly developed and highly populated. We also found that many places have two types of structure; small hubs that are used more often, and a wider range of routes that handle the rest of longer flights to all over the world. There's a limited number of planes being used, with kinds like Boeing being the most popular by far. Further research that could be done is comparing the data direcly to population maps. We could also examine the infrastructure and ecomic standings of the countries in the data set and see if they have an effect on air travel in that given country.
